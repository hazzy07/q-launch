            For clarity: a trademark is a word, slogan, symbol or design that is
            used to distinguish one person's or company's products or services
            from another's. The owner of a trademark may stop others from using
            the mark or confusingly similar marks.

            pump.fun's trademark guidelines are intended to avoid confusion
            about who provides, is affiliated with or otherwise endorses a
            creator's token, livestream, comments, or any other content. Please
            note that these guidelines apply only to the website accessible from
            the "pump.fun" or "swap.pump.fun" urls. These guidelines do not
            apply information which is stored on a blockchain, or any website
            that we do not control. To that end, our trademark guidelines are
            straightforward:

                permission.
              </li>

              <li>
                Don't use someone else's trademark in a way that is intended to
                or may cause legitimate confusion about whether you own a mark.
              </li>

              <li>
                Obtain explicit permission before using someone's trademark and
                before publishing any content suggesting that a trademark owner
                is an affiliate, sponsor, partner, or otherwise endorses you or
                your content.

              <li>
                create parodies, commentary, or fan content, but you must (1) be
                clear that your content is such a parody, commentary, or fan
                content and is not affiliated with the trademark, and (2)
                include some caveat in the title of your content to distinguish
                it (e.g., "[trademark] fan," "[trademark] parody," "[trademark]
                commentary").

            Have a great time making fun of, enjoying, and praising others—but
            do not pretend you are them in a way that would confuse an ordinary
            person.

            When pump.fun receives a trademark infringement report, pump.fun
            will:
            <ul className="mx-4 list-disc  ">
              <li>
                Assess the report to determine if it's legitimate and all

              </li>

              <li>
                Evaluate the report against these guidelines, pump.fun's content

              <li>
                If we determine, in our sole discretion, that content on our
                website violates the trademark rights of another, we will remove

                pump.fun allows the creator to submit a response, which may be

            </ul>
            If you (the creator) are alerted to a violation and do not believe
